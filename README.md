During the summer I like to open our windows in the morning to let the cool air in, but the problem is sometimes I forget to close them, or even when I do remember, I’m not sure if I should close them yet or keep them open a little longer (based on the outside temperature and inside temperature difference). Enter a DIY project with my newly learned Micropython skills.
I wanted to create something that would send a push notification to my phone letting me know that I should close my windows in the morning because the temperature outside was almost equal to the temperature in my house and also let me know when to open my windows in the evening to maximize my use of God’s free air-conditioning.
